Originally studying Biology at the University of Sheffield, I got heavily involved in student media. From there, I studied a postgrad degree in Broadcast Journalism, freelanced, mixed up with an assortment of content generation and digital comms roles. I currently [mentor student journalists](http://join.smoke.media) down in London.

Alongside that, I'm a self-taught frontend web developer, especially fluent with Wordpress theming and static site generators like Jekyll (which this site is made of!) I'm capable to various degrees in PHP, JS (vanilla and jQuery), Ruby and Python.

I'm a keen photographer with too many rolls of 35mm film waiting to be developed, and I know all the best theatres in London.
