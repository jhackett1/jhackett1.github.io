Originally studying Biology at the University of Sheffield, I got heavily involved in student media. From there, I studied a postgrad degree in Broadcast Journalism, freelanced, mixed up with an assortment of content generation and digital comms roles. After a year [mentoring student journalists](http://join.smoke.media) down in London, I now work in agile delivery for the government.

I'm a self-taught web developer, especially fluent with Javascript and bespoke Wordpress plugin/theme work. I'm capable to various degrees in Node.js, Express, React, Gulp, Webpack and similar tools and frameworks.

I'm a keen photographer with too many rolls of 35mm film waiting to be developed, and I know all the best theatres in London.
