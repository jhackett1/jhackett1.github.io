    <main>
      <p>Ten year old Rose falls down a hole. Rescuers find her in the palm of a half-buried enormous metal hand, which proceeds to baffle all experts until a now-adult Rose is put back on the case by a mysterious financier.</p>

<p>More body parts are eventually discovered, and as they are collected, it becomes clear that they are all pieces of a single machine (a hand or a head might be independent objects of veneration, but a thigh?).</p>

<p>As the extraterrestrial nature of the find becomes clear, a tale of political intrigue and conspiracies emerges as various parties seek to weaponise the robot, eventually pushing the world to the brink of war.</p>

<p>The central gimmick of <em>Sleeping Giants</em> is that is told in an interview format, all conducted by a nameless, near-omniscient interviewer. Though their identity remains shady throughout, we come to realise they are the only one who has any real idea what’s going on.</p>

<blockquote><q>As the extraterrestrial nature of the find becomes clear, a tale of political intrigue and conspiracies emerges.</q></blockquote>

<p>Greater plot momentum toward the end of the book means it begins to labour under the weight of this narrative mechanism: the interview format does not lend itself well to fight scenes, for instance. These scenes just about hold together with a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>On its face, the story of <em>Sleeping Giants</em> is as genre as genre fiction gets. The premise of an enormous robot, piloted by a psychologically attuned duo, engineered to fight hand-to-hand with a presumably equally large foe, is certainly borrowed from <em>Pacific Rim</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/giants_1.jpg" alt="'Artwork: '" /></p>

<p>The characters too are sci-fi archetypes. Dr Rose Franklin is one more version of the multidisciplinary brainbox scientist descended from Mr Spock and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Carter">SG-1’s Samantha Carter</a>, somehow equally comfortable with molecular genetics and mechanical engineering. Kara Resnik owes much to the hard-talking, no-nonsense women pilots from <em>Aliens</em> all the way through to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Thrace"><em>Battlestar Galactica</em></a>.</p>

<p>Despite these trite beginnings, the real  achievement of <em>Sleeping Giants</em> is how author Sylvain Neuvel brings these archetypes to life. Their actions and relationships are totally convincing, despite us never seeing them interact with anyone except the interviewer.</p>

<blockquote><q>The celluloid practically jumps off the page.</q></blockquote>

<p><em>Sleeping Giants</em> is the debut novel you wish you’d written, if only you’d had the courage to move beyond all that fanfic.</p>

<p>Though it pays a heavy debt to genre convention, <em>Sleeping Giants</em> mixes in just enough originality to make it a compelling joy to read - giddy with the possibilities of its own universe.</p>

<p>Apparently, a film adaptation is imminent. The celluloid practically jumps off the page.</p>
