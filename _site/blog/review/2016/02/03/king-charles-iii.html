    <hr />
    <main>
      <p>If Queen Elizabeth died tomorrow, what would happen? That’s the question posed by <em>King Charles III</em>, which imagines the first few months of the Prince of Wales’ reign.</p>

<p>Charles wastes no time exercising his power, refusing to allow a particular Act of Parliament to become law. It all spirals downhill from there.</p>

<p>For the first forty minutes, you find yourself wondering what <em>King Charles III</em> is trying to be; a satire, a serious drama, a comedy? After an impressive opening funeral scene, the first act is mainly held up by cheap shots at Harry’s parentage and Charles’ delayed shot at the throne, but once this is out of the way, the play matures into something much more interesting.</p>

<p>It becomes clear that the play is a reimagining of classic Shakespeare plays. Anyone who’s studied a Shakespearean history or tragedy will recognise the components; political intrigue, family drama, jealousy, love, vengeance and levity.</p>

<blockquote><q>A complex, delightfully imagined play.</q></blockquote>

<p><em>King Charles III</em>’s pedigree also comes across in the classical verse used in its dialogue, but this makes the modern profanity lacing the script unintentionally comedic.</p>

<p>A subplot involving Harry’s romantic entanglements with a commoner is a well-conceived add levity to the proceedings, but once Charles’ feud with Parliament and the Prime Minister heats up, it ends up being more of an unwelcome distraction from the political intrigue at the heart of the play.</p>

<p>Robert Powell’s portrayal of the beleaguered monarch brings the gravitas and well-meaning interventionism the role demands. Surrounded by crumbling ancient stone walls, he comes to embody an institution in, perhaps terminal, decline.</p>

<p>The decision to place the nation’s beloved; William and Kate, as the Machiavellian villains of the piece, is nothing short of inspired. The portrayal of the Duchess of Cambridge as cunning and ambitious is a great fit for the modern age, along with harkening back brilliantly to classical manipulators such as Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>Infused with elements modern and traditional, <em>King Charles III</em> is a complex, delightfully imagined play, let down by a weak first act. Once we push into the substance of the plot, it becomes a very satisfying production which asks difficult questions about the future of the British monarchy.</p>
