      <p>How do you convey a totalitarian dystopia to an audience without using a single syllable of dialogue? That’s the challenge Northern Ballet set for themselves when they decided that a bold new adaptation of Orwell’s masterpiece would be the centrepiece of their new season.</p>

<p>Written in the wake of the Second World War, the novel portrays an authoritarian future state under the auspices of the omnipresent Big Brother. In this world, even language is manipulated to deter rebellion, and those who step out of line find swift punishment. So when protagonist Winston falls in love and starts to nurture ideas of overthrowing Big Brother, trouble is inevitable.</p>

<blockquote><q>The dance medium allows new opportunities that make up for the lack of dialogue</q></blockquote>

<p>Choreographer Johnathan Watkins recalls that he first read the novel at fourteen. A student at the Royal Ballet School at the time, the individual-against-the-system themes stuck with him. He looks back on this as a fairly naive understanding, but admits that the ideas of individuality and exploring how people act differently when they’re being observed by others still intrigue him.</p>

<p>When asked how a dance production can address elements of the book like Newspeak (the invented language of the totalitarian state, tailored to prohibit rebellion by purging the vocabulary needed to discuss it), Watkins notes that the dance medium allows new opportunities that make up for the lack of dialogue.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/1984_2.jpg" alt="'Photo: Justin Slee'" /></p>

<p>“Dance allows us to say things that the text can’t,” he says, “This is a story about people being physically controlled, and dance is the perfect medium to show that.”</p>

<p>“We can’t directly portray things like Newspeak, but we can adjust the physicality of characters to show how they are being influenced.” Characters under constant surveillance move in a very rigid, military manner, with every motion precisely timed and coordinated. The working-class proles, who evade Big Brother’s attention through sheer numbers, are free to move in a more organic, loose manner.</p>

<p>Watkins was enticed to start work on the production by the Snowden revelations (as told through Laura Poitras’ compelling documentary, Citizenfour), and the LED screens that will adorn the stage owe a lot to the gargantuan screens in Tienanmen square that made headlines last year for flaunting images of glorious sunrises to a smog-laden Beijing.</p>

<p>While the novel means different things to different people, the whole team agrees that it has an unmistakable timeless quality. “1984 doesn’t really mean 1984”, says Watkins, “It’s a prediction and it could happen at any time.”</p>

<blockquote><q>Care is being taken to avoid anything that could date the production</q></blockquote>

<p>The lead dancers, Martha Leebolt and Tobias Batley, note that the quiet acceptance of surveillance in 1984 is a close relative to our modern love affair with smartphones. “But we were keen to avoid overt Facebook and Twitter references”, they say – care is being taken to avoid anything that could date the production.</p>

<p>The theme of control and uniformity is central to the set and costume design. The dancers will don blue uniforms; a compromise between the blue overalls of the novel and the need for something one can dance in. Costume designer Simon Daw was inspired by the factory workwear donned in Chinese factories, seeking to combine it with a more traditional office attire. Rather than the normal practice of name tags, codes are instead sewn into the costumes, in keeping with the production’s themes.</p>

<p>In the scant scenes taking place beyond the reach of Big Brother’s surveillance, the environment will be depicted as hyper-real, almost alien, as though we are seeing through the eyes of characters who have been surveilled their entire lives.</p>

<p>The team readily admit that when confronted with the idea of a 1984 ballet, many struggle to understand how such a thing could possibly work. Artistic director David Nixon muses; “People can feel safer with theatre than dance, because the spoken word clarifies things”. But after seeing the rehearsals in full flow and getting a glimpse at the depth of thought that has gone into realising this ballet, it’s clear that it is set to impress aficionados and the unconverted alike.</p>
