&lt;p&gt;They get waylaid, of course, and the crew, which includes Katherine Waterston’s Daniels, eventually runs into Michael Fassbender’s errant android, David on a strange deserted world, ten years after he was last seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/alien-covenant-ridley-scott-prometheus-release-date-trailer-xenomorph-a7731851.html&quot;&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director Ridley Scott essentially admits that after the frosty reception of &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, the iconic xenomorph was shoe-horned back in here as a convoluted form of fan-service, and it shows. &lt;em&gt;Covenant&lt;/em&gt; spends its first two acts aping the big themes and expansive locales of &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, and its last act duplicating the claustrophobic horrors of the 1979 original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;q&gt;David's presence is the only thing lifting Covenant from mediocrity&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthetics have always been nearly as core to the Alien franchise as the titular creature, portrayed variously as foils and helpers to the human characters, but have never taken centre stage before now, with not one but two androids in the main cast, both played by Fassbender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is very little that modern audiences don’t know about the xenomorph - so it’s hard to keep them scary. The first film thrived on the simple &lt;em&gt;unknowable other-ness&lt;/em&gt; of the creature, but nearly four decades on, there’s very little of that left to play on. It’s good, then, that the story of &lt;em&gt;Alien: Covenant&lt;/em&gt; is really more about David and the creation of life, than the titular aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/covenant_3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The xenomorphs have been resurrected after their conspicuous absence in Prometheus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, David’s presence is the only thing lifting &lt;em&gt;Covenant&lt;/em&gt; from mediocrity. It’s the same move Ridley tried to pull with &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt; - marrying the sci-fi body horror with Big Themes®, but in 2012, after the franchise had been on ice for so long, the move was unexpected and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesthetically, the design of the &lt;em&gt;Covenant&lt;/em&gt; is halfway between the clean, high-tech, world of &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt; (taking its cues from the present day), and the dirty 70s retro-future of the original film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/covenant_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Despite publicity, Katherine Waterston's Daniels is never as interesting as Fassbender's two android characters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s generally a bad idea to rely on human stupidity to create tension, and while the bad decision-making and rough characterisation that blighted &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt; aren’t gone, they are certainly more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, just as in the 2012 prequel, you never quite buy into the characters’ personalities enough to see them as more than xenomorph-fodder. With the &lt;em&gt;Covenant&lt;/em&gt;’s crew of six or seven couples, there’s just too many to get to know over the course of 120 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;q&gt;We never buy into the characters' personalities enough to see them as more than xenomorph-fodder&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is loaded with the kind of poor character choices that might make sense for the blue-collar crew of the &lt;em&gt;Nostromo&lt;/em&gt;, but are bizarre and out of place for the presumably talented and trained professionals we encounter here. Billy Crudup’s captain, Oram, has an unspecified ‘faith’ which, perplexingly, the film only really uses to explain away his general incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final moments of the film rely on a twist so obvious that we end up angry at the characters for not seeing it coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairly gratuitous liberties are taken with the alien’s life cycle. While  the original films tried to at least maintain a semblance of biological realism (acidic blood notwithstanding), Covenent makes the species essentially magical - going from facehugger, to chestburster, to full-grown adult in a matter of minutes - a speed which strains suspension of disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Covenant&lt;/em&gt; is definitely a better film than &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, but it’d need a few more decades of hypersleep to catch up with &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Five years on from Prometheus’ high concept and flawed execution, Alien: Covenant follows a colony ship carrying thousands of hibernating humans to a new world.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/covenant_1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hyperlog - a 24/7 utility for internet radio</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/work/digital/ux/2017/05/05/hyperlog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hyperlog - a 24/7 utility for internet radio" /><published>2017-05-05T13:00:20+01:00</published><updated>2017-05-05T13:00:20+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/work/digital/ux/2017/05/05/hyperlog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/work/digital/ux/2017/05/05/hyperlog.html">&lt;p&gt;In most localities, radio stations must maintain a complete log of their on-air output. Advertisers and station staff may also wish to monitor broadcast output, and presenters are increasingly seeking easy ways to make their shows available to a wider audience as podcasts. Therefore, radio logging software was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, traditional logging software must run on specialist hardware and needs a direct audio input from a live studio. Industry-standard solutions are prohibitively expensive for community and student radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, Hyperlog is the only cloud-based audio logger: it listens only to what is actually broadcast, so it can run on any server anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/hyperlog_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Hyperlog user interface.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperlog is a web application based on node.js. It runs 24/7 on the recording server and is accessible via any web browser. It makes regular hourly recordings of broadcast output, and can also log the metadata of each hour, by making a request to the API of the radio station’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recordings can then be perused using the browser UI. Metadata like show name, description and genre is attached to each recording, and each can be downloaded. It also has a simple read-only API to integrate with a station’s other online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administrator can specify a maximum number of hours to archive (eg. one week, one month), at which point Hyperlog will begin deleting the oldest recordings. In most localities, regulators require a 30-day log to be retained.  Important recordings can be “pinned” to prevent automatic deletion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next iteration of Hyperlog will integrate with third party services like Mixcloud, Audioboom and Soundcloud, enabling automatic uploading of radio shows so they can be promoted and shared as podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">In most localities, radio stations must maintain a complete log of their on-air output.

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/impactreport_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The report is divided into scrollable sections, with a strong branded colour scheme.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the content from the print version of the report, rewriting copy for a web audience where needed, teasing out key statistics and drawing simple icons and vector illustrations to accompany the stats. After assembling the content, I moved onto wireframes and sketch mockups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I coded the concept from the ground-up, incorporating SVG animations, Javascript-driven interactivity, pie and bar charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/impactreport_4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;I began, as always, with content, followed by wireframes and mockups.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactive, animated graphs were developed for the report using the popular D3.js (Data Driven Documents) library. These respond to the user’s cursor or touch interaction and are fully mobile-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">While at Westminster Students’ Union, I was tasked with making an online version of the organisation’s annual impact report, which is normally distributed in print format.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/impactreport_2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ghost in the Shell: Stunning but simplistic</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/review/2017/03/31/ghost-in-the-shell.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ghost in the Shell: Stunning but simplistic" /><published>2017-03-31T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-03-31T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/review/2017/03/31/ghost-in-the-shell</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/review/2017/03/31/ghost-in-the-shell.html">&lt;p&gt;Willing suspension of disbelief means audiences will accept the outright impossible, but they’re less likely to forgive what they know to be simply improbable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the idea that in a few decades most positions of power in Japan will be held by white people strains credibility &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; than the prospect of implanting a human brain into a robotic body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;The themes of the original anime are simplified for a Western audience.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s adaptation of the seminal &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt; anime, starring Scarlett Johansson as a cybernetically-enhanced crimefighter known as the Major, courted early controversy over perceived white-washing of Asian roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience is made dimly aware of a massive influx of Western refugees to the film’s near-future cyberpunk version of Japan, presumably due to some reversal of fortunes overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fact that the Major - a Japanese woman working for the Japanese government, is being played by Scarlett Johanssen, proves to be a plot point of sorts, does not fully excuse this, especially since there are barely a handful of Asian speaking roles in the whole film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/gits_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Several scenes are shot-fot-shot recreations of the anime.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adaptation simplifies the themes and plot threads of the source material for a more demanding Western audience. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as it brings a new focus to the Major’s personal struggle and her emotional turmoil, and brings a much-needed human dimension to the philosophising of the source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the process, a lot of the ambiguity and thematic textures which made the original anime so beloved are left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, part of the appeal of Mamoru Oshii’s 1995 anime was the subtlety of its portrayal of technology. In this adaptation, cybernetics are closely allied to corporate corruption and destruction. Big bad Hanka Robotics may as well be &lt;em&gt;Robocop&lt;/em&gt;’s OCP or &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;’s Weyland-Yutani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate corruption angle is done to death in Western sci-fi (take James Cameron’s &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; as examples), but feels weirdly tacked on here, though it’s certainly necessary to bring a more accessible, singular villain to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/gits_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;'Visually speaking, the film is impeccable.'&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is unapologetically about Johansson’s character. Of the supporting cast, only Pilou Asbæk’s Batou and Takeshi Kitano’s Chief Aramaki get a chance to prove their worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;The neon-soaked high-rise world of this year's Ghost in the Shell is genuinely stunning to look at&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe’s near-perfect score is an enticing blend of the original anime’s haunting chorals and the 80s synths we’re familiar with from Mansell’s work on &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;’s memorable ‘San Junipero’ episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt; pays no shortage of tributes to its source anime. Some scenes are shot-for-shot recreations of scenes from the original anime. Even a beagle makes it in - a Mamoru Oshii signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neon-soaked high-rise world of this year’s &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt; is genuinely stunning to look at, and the film rightfully strips down the plot to focus on the individual drama of Johansson’s character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, without the philosophical musings that so defined the source material, it’s easy to feel that the soul - or “ghost” - of the franchise has been lost along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Willing suspension of disbelief means audiences will accept the outright impossible, but they’re less likely to forgive what they know to be simply improbable.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/gits_1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Life - A creepy-crawly space station nightmare</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/review/2017/03/24/life.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Life - A creepy-crawly space station nightmare" /><published>2017-03-24T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-03-24T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/review/2017/03/24/life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/review/2017/03/24/life.html">&lt;p&gt;As we send out probe after probe specifically intended to hunt for life beyond earth, it doesn’t seem as unlikely as it once did that we might actually find some.  So it’s an appropriate time for flicks like &lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt;, which imagine what might happen if that life turns out to be not so friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, a space probe carrying precious Martian samples is grabbed by a souped-up international space station, and the six-astronaut crew investigate the traces of life aboard, keeping it quarantined in the relative isolation of the orbiting laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named Calvin by school kids back on earth, the cells begin to reanimate, and grow alarmingly fast. It goes downhill from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; tries, with varying success, to mix the body horror and claustrophobia of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; with the high-octane zero-gee excitement of &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; and other modern orbital thrill-rides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the tropes are firmly in place: tracking an unknown terror on motion sensors, limited weaponry, astronauts being picked off one by one. Even the typography of the opening title is shamelessly lifted from Ridley Scott’s classics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international space station is an intriguing setting, taking inspiration from the present-day station and bulking it up considerably to reflect a decade or so of future expansion. The passageways, nooks and crannies lend themselves so perfectly to this kind of suspenseful horror it’s a wonder no one’s thought of it before. There’s clear attention to detail in the design of the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/life_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Gyllenhaal gets the most to do of the six astronauts, but we never really get to know him.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astronauts remain paper-thin sketches, with just enough personality added into the mix to make them believable, but viewers will struggle to name a single character hours after leaving the cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the nature of the sci-fi horror genre that the characters are scientists - presumably well-trained, level-headed professionals. Yet, those characters &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to fail gratuitously: blundering into quarantine zones, making all the wrong choices, simply in order to drive the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a balancing act that 2013’s &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt; got completely wrong, for instance. It’s better executed here - just well enough to keep you believing that these ISS astronauts do actually know what they’re doing ninety per cent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is finely-strung and genuinely suspenseful, but only really comes into its own once it makes it clear that the extraterrestrial Calvin won’t be defeated by conventional means. After all, even Ripley eventually managed to dispatch &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;’s xenomorph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And without spoilers, the bait and switch coming into play for the film’s final scene is masterful, finally delivering on the potential the film had been holding back to that point. It’s the closing moments which make &lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">As we send out probe after probe specifically intended to hunt for life beyond earth, it doesn’t seem as unlikely as it once did that we might actually find some.

Rescuers find her in the palm of a half-buried enormous metal hand, which proceeds to baffle all experts until a now-adult Rose is put back on the case by a mysterious financier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More body parts are eventually discovered, and as they are collected, it becomes clear that they are all pieces of a single machine (a hand or a head might be independent objects of veneration, but a thigh?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the extraterrestrial nature of the find becomes clear, a tale of political intrigue and conspiracies emerges as various parties seek to weaponise the robot, eventually pushing the world to the brink of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central gimmick of &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/em&gt; is that is told in an interview format, all conducted by a nameless, near-omniscient interviewer. Though their identity remains shady throughout, we come to realise they are the only one who has any real idea what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;As the extraterrestrial nature of the find becomes clear, a tale of political intrigue and conspiracies emerges.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater plot momentum toward the end of the book means it begins to labour under the weight of this narrative mechanism: the interview format does not lend itself well to fight scenes, for instance. These scenes just about hold together with a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its face, the story of &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/em&gt; is as genre as genre fiction gets. The premise of an enormous robot, piloted by a psychologically attuned duo, engineered to fight hand-to-hand with a presumably equally large foe, is certainly borrowed from &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/giants_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;'Artwork: '&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters too are sci-fi archetypes. Dr Rose Franklin is one more version of the multidisciplinary brainbox scientist descended from Mr Spock and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Carter&quot;&gt;SG-1’s Samantha Carter&lt;/a&gt;, somehow equally comfortable with molecular genetics and mechanical engineering. Kara Resnik owes much to the hard-talking, no-nonsense women pilots from &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; all the way through to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Thrace&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these trite beginnings, the real  achievement of &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/em&gt; is how author Sylvain Neuvel brings these archetypes to life. Their actions and relationships are totally convincing, despite us never seeing them interact with anyone except the interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;The celluloid practically jumps off the page.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/em&gt; is the debut novel you wish you’d written, if only you’d had the courage to move beyond all that fanfic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it pays a heavy debt to genre convention, &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/em&gt; mixes in just enough originality to make it a compelling joy to read - giddy with the possibilities of its own universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, a film adaptation is imminent. The celluloid practically jumps off the page.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Ten year old Rose falls down a hole.

They took home the Student Radio Association’s award for best station in 2015, and were shortlisted again in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I became student media coordinator in early 2016, the station was facing several issues with its broadcast infrastructure. The media server being used relied on Flash, which has virtually no mobile support and rapidly declining desktop support. This massively limited the potential audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station operates across all four of the University of Westminster’ campuses, with studios in central London and up in Harrow. However, taking a different studio live was time-consuming and difficult, so rarely done, again limiting participation and membership on particular campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Smoke Radio's implementation of the Airtime system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replaced the existing proprietary media server with two pieces of open-source software. For basic streaming, I went with Icecast, which is the gold standard for audio webcasting. It supports MP3 as well as higher efficiency codecs like AAC, and does not rely on Flash. This streaming protocol is also compatible with hardware audio decoders, and these are now being obtained and installed in social areas on campus, to improve listenership and brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icecast was controlled by the second piece of software, Airtime. Airtime functions as a central scheduling and playout manager. Media can be uploaded and connections to various studios established, and so live shows, pre-recorded shows and outside broadcasts can be made according to a single central calendar. Switchover became automated and hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These upgrades also laid crucial groundwork for a cross-platform mobile app for on-the-go listening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Smoke Radio is one of the top student radio stations in the UK, involving nearly one hundred students every year and broadcasting 24/7.

&lt;p&gt;Before I began work, Smoke’s web presence was disparate, consisting of a Youtube channel, two aged and dissimilar Wordpress sites, and a free Wix site. All used out-of-the-box templates with minimal customisation. Most importantly, all were very different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my strategic priorities was to shift Smoke Media from a print-first to a digital-first organisation, reflecting the shift going on in the wider world. It was also vital to communicate a single, converged brand to our audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with student stakeholders to come up with a feature set and compile design ideas for the new website. I introduced students to a common web design progress: &lt;strong&gt;brief, wireframe, mockups, prototypes and product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very important that the new site automate common tasks such as the uploading of electronic versions of print publications, a process which involved many manual, tedious steps. Integration with external services such as Youtube, Audioboom and a number of custom in-house APIs was also necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/smoke_media_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The website combines content and functionality from Westminster SU's student-led radio &amp;amp; TV station, newspaper and magazine.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than using Wordpress multisite or completely seperate websites to give the impression of convergence while still being seperate under the bonnet, the new Smoke website makes clever use of customised category pages and custom fields to offer a multimedia experience which is met by few other student media groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student media volunteers can replace a default featured image with a video or piece of audio, allowing for easy collaborations between outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A custom post type &lt;strong&gt;live events&lt;/strong&gt; allows video livestreams, radio broadcast players and text liveblogs to be combined on a single topic for converged coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website automatically imports recently uploaded content to Audioboom, Youtube and Issuu, among other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/smoke_media_1.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The website features special content sections to promote particular campaigns.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new website offers a fit-for-purpose platform for publishing content, and is the ideal springboard to bring Westminster’s two publications into the digital-first present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also enable the later development of a cross-platform mobile application, which will automatically fetch content from the website database using the Wordpress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">As part of my role as student media coordinator, I initiated a ground-up rebuild of Smoke Media’s web presence in 2016.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/work1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Review: Ugly Lies the Bone</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/ugly-lies-the-bone.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review: Ugly Lies the Bone" /><published>2017-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/ugly-lies-the-bone</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/ugly-lies-the-bone.html">&lt;p&gt;The National Theatre’s new production follows a wounded veteran, Jess, as she returns to her family home on the Florida coast on the eve of the final space shuttle launch, and experiments with a pioneering new virtual reality therapy to heal her emotional trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This play is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an inspirational tale of overcoming difficult odds. But nor is it a depressing tale about how some wounds can never heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate Fleetwood, who portrays Jess, expertly treads the fine emotional line between hardened veteran and vulnerable sister - at one moment attempting to reignite a lost romance with a former boyfriend (Ralf Little), the next laying a verbal smackdown on her new deadbeat brother in law (Kris Marshall, with his best American drawl).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jess and her family inhabit a drab, featureless world surrounded by steep, curved walls. All the characters’ actions take place trapped at the bottom of this literal bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an assured choice of staging which gets across Jess’ feeling of being captive in her own body well,  as well as being an astute metaphor for the economic woes afflicting the entire Space Coast as the shuttle program winds down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world only ever springs to life during Jess’ VR therapy sessions. The plain walls become a canvas for lavish outdoor scenes: from glassy lakes to snow-covered mountains. The video projection and lighting spectacular used to convey these therapy sessions is nothing short of an extravagant visual achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jess struggles to reconnect with her family and old friends, all the while taking refuge in astounding virtual wonderlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It eventually becomes clear to Jess that despite its initial appeal, the virtual world has its limits. The well-meaning doctor who administers the therapy is remains unseen apart from her voice, perhaps hinting at the lack of any genuine human connection to be found in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear to the audience from the outset that the virtual world is incomplete, so it doesn’t come as much of a surprise to us when Jess catches on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ugly Lies the Bone&lt;/em&gt; fizzles away without any firm conclusion or catharsis. What message are we to take away from it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understated ending is almost certainly a commentary on the nature of Jess’ recovery. there are no simple solutions or answers to be found - everything is a process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit by bit, she will get better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">The National Theatre’s new production follows a wounded veteran, Jess, as she returns to her family home on the Florida coast on the eve of the final space shuttle launch, and experiments with a pioneering new virtual reality therapy to heal her emotional trauma.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/ugly_1.jpg" /></entry></feed>
