They took home the Student Radio Association’s award for best station in 2015, and were shortlisted again in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I became student media coordinator in early 2016, the station was facing several issues with its broadcast infrastructure. The media server being used relied on Flash, which has virtually no mobile support and rapidly declining desktop support. This massively limited the potential audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station operates across all four of the University of Westminster’ campuses, with studios in central London and up in Harrow. However, taking a different studio live was time-consuming and difficult, so rarely done, again limiting participation and membership on particular campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/radio_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Smoke Radio's implementation of the Airtime system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replaced the existing proprietary media server with two pieces of open-source software. For basic streaming, I went with Icecast, which is the gold standard for audio webcasting. It supports MP3 as well as higher efficiency codecs like AAC, and does not rely on Flash. This streaming protocol is also compatible with hardware audio decoders, and these are now being obtained and installed in social areas on campus, to improve listenership and brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icecast was controlled by the second piece of software, Airtime. Airtime functions as a central scheduling and playout manager. Media can be uploaded and connections to various studios established, and so live shows, pre-recorded shows and outside broadcasts can be made according to a single central calendar. Switchover became automated and hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These upgrades also laid crucial groundwork for a cross-platform mobile app for on-the-go listening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Smoke Radio is one of the top student radio stations in the UK, involving nearly one hundred students every year and broadcasting 24/7.

&lt;p&gt;Before I began work, Smoke’s web presence was disparate, consisting of a Youtube channel, two aged and dissimilar Wordpress sites, and a free Wix site. All used out-of-the-box templates with minimal customisation. Most importantly, all were very different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my strategic priorities was to shift Smoke Media from a print-first to a digital-first organisation, reflecting the shift going on in the wider world. It was also vital to communicate a single, converged brand to our audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with student stakeholders to come up with a feature set and compile design ideas for the new website. I introduced students to a common web design progress: &lt;strong&gt;brief, wireframe, mockups, prototypes and product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very important that the new site automate common tasks such as the uploading of electronic versions of print publications, a process which involved many manual, tedious steps. Integration with external services such as Youtube, Audioboom and a number of custom in-house APIs was also necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/smoke_media_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The website combines content and functionality from Westminster SU's student-led radio &amp;amp; TV station, newspaper and magazine.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than using Wordpress multisite or completely seperate websites to give the impression of convergence while still being seperate under the bonnet, the new Smoke website makes clever use of customised category pages and custom fields to offer a multimedia experience which is met by few other student media groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student media volunteers can replace a default featured image with a video or piece of audio, allowing for easy collaborations between outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A custom post type &lt;strong&gt;live events&lt;/strong&gt; allows video livestreams, radio broadcast players and text liveblogs to be combined on a single topic for converged coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website automatically imports recently uploaded content to Audioboom, Youtube and Issuu, among other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/smoke_media_1.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The website features special content sections to promote particular campaigns.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new website offers a fit-for-purpose platform for publishing content, and is the ideal springboard to bring Westminster’s two publications into the digital-first present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also enable the later development of a cross-platform mobile application, which will automatically fetch content from the website database using the Wordpress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">As part of my role as student media coordinator, I initiated a ground-up rebuild of Smoke Media’s web presence in 2016.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/work1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Review: Ugly Lies the Bone</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/ugly-lies-the-bone.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review: Ugly Lies the Bone" /><published>2017-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/ugly-lies-the-bone</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/ugly-lies-the-bone.html">&lt;p&gt;The National Theatre’s new production follows a wounded veteran, Jess, as she returns to her family home on the Florida coast on the eve of the final space shuttle launch, and experiments with a pioneering new virtual reality therapy to heal her emotional trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This play is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an inspirational tale of overcoming difficult odds. But nor is it a depressing tale about how some wounds can never heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate Fleetwood, who portrays Jess, expertly treads the fine emotional line between hardened veteran and vulnerable sister - at one moment attempting to reignite a lost romance with a former boyfriend (Ralf Little), the next laying a verbal smackdown on her new deadbeat brother in law (Kris Marshall, with his best American drawl).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jess and her family inhabit a drab, featureless world surrounded by steep, curved walls. All the characters’ actions take place trapped at the bottom of this literal bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an assured choice of staging which gets across Jess’ feeling of being captive in her own body well,  as well as being an astute metaphor for the economic woes afflicting the entire Space Coast as the shuttle program winds down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world only ever springs to life during Jess’ VR therapy sessions. The plain walls become a canvas for lavish outdoor scenes: from glassy lakes to snow-covered mountains. The video projection and lighting spectacular used to convey these therapy sessions is nothing short of an extravagant visual achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jess struggles to reconnect with her family and old friends, all the while taking refuge in astounding virtual wonderlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/ugly_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Kate Fleetwood as Jess. Photo: Mark Douet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It eventually becomes clear to Jess that despite its initial appeal, the virtual world has its limits. The well-meaning doctor who administers the therapy is remains unseen apart from her voice, perhaps hinting at the lack of any genuine human connection to be found in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear to the audience from the outset that the virtual world is incomplete, so it doesn’t come as much of a surprise to us when Jess catches on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ugly Lies the Bone&lt;/em&gt; fizzles away without any firm conclusion or catharsis. What message are we to take away from it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understated ending is almost certainly a commentary on the nature of Jess’ recovery. there are no simple solutions or answers to be found - everything is a process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit by bit, she will get better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">The National Theatre’s new production follows a wounded veteran, Jess, as she returns to her family home on the Florida coast on the eve of the final space shuttle launch, and experiments with a pioneering new virtual reality therapy to heal her emotional trauma.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/ugly_1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Why most 360 video is no good</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/360-video.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why most 360 video is no good" /><published>2017-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/360-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/14/360-video.html">&lt;p&gt;Most 360 video you can find today falls into one of two types: it either tells a story, or conveys a sense of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveying a mere sense of place is much easier than convincing a viewer to invest in your story. Cinematography is the set of rules that let us direct the viewer’s eye, convincing them to make that investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good videographer knows the path they want the viewer’s eyes to take through a scene, and composes their shot using stuff like the rule of thirds, leading lines and playful use of light and shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, what you leave out of a shot is just as important, if not more so, than what you leave in. Being a good photographer or videographer is all about making each shot parsimonious: knowing why it exists and framing each shot to tell a single message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But 360 video upends that formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the normal rules of composition no longer apply. You can’t really direct the viewer’s eye and have no way of knowing what will be in their field of view at a given moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a 360 video of the first type — a music video with a narrative it wants you to invest in…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/91fQTXrSRZE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No real sustained close-ups, no selective focus, no framing. You could well argue that it looks a lot less immersive than conventional video, contrary to the traditional promise of 360.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, these kinds of 360 videos harken back to the early days of filmmaking, where shallow focus was rare and expensive, and directors had to fall back on old theatre blocking techniques when designing their shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directors like Wes Anderson, Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles still make heavy use of deep focus, generally because they think it’s a better portrayal of reality. It’s more like theatre than what we now think of as filmmaking, where you don’t have as much control over where the viewer’s gaze goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/360_2.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Shining.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, we’ll come up with new rules of composition designed expressly for the new medium of 360/VR. They’ll be based on the existing rules of videography, but not the same, just as the rules of composition we use for photography originated in those found in classical artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the closest traditional analogy to 360 is that of theatre in the round. The audience’s viewpoint and that being observed are reversed, but it’s the closest analogy we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theatre in the round is notoriously difficult to do well, because directors have to consider sight lines from all sides of the stage. It’s a lot harder to create a mise-en-scene when the normal definitions of foreground, midground and background cease to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/360_3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;'Theatre in the round'&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like at the moment, 360 video is most at home when the goal is simply to convey a sense of place — a sense of “being somewhere”. Most works of journalism produced with 360 video so far fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same use case as the humble GoPro, and certainly there are many consumer 360 cameras clearly targeting the same audience. Though it’s surely been attempted, the GoPro is no one’s go-to tool for a short film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are limitations even with this less ambitious use case. Luckily, these are technical, not artistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sfVvJY-C8gA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumer 360 cameras still have 1080p sensors. Shared between two fisheye lenses, the end product is usually a great deal lower quality than conventional video, since there are less pixels in your field of view (FOV) at any moment, since the sensor’s pixels are being spread across the whole 360 panorama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when content is created in 4K, like the above BBC livestream, it’s still not good enough for a seamless VR effect. It looks like we’ll have to wait for even higher-resolution sensors to meet the promise of “as if you were there” 360/VR video. Compression applied by Facebook and Youtube when sharing doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s without even thinking of the problem of network connections. The UK’s average broadband download speed is currently around 22mbps, but there’s still no shortage of households which still can’t manage to download a 4k quality video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 4G cell speeds are generally plenty fast enough for 4K, data caps definitely aren’t. A few ten minute 4K videos will burn through the monthly limit without blinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the chief complaints about VR video is that it always looks so soft. Early headsets were stuck with dismal displays, but more modern headsets like the Vive have improved. There’s a lot of work to be done on resolution, but low quality video is an increasingly important barrier to immersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/360_4.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The HTC Vive.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this certainly isn’t a condemnation of 360 video. It’s less than five years old, and conventional video has been around for nearly a century. Any new technology needs to be given time to develop its niche and for us to learn how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that the technical hurdles with 360 will be solved long before a new formal artistic “grammar” emerges for the medium. After all, the rule of thirds was only named in the 1700s, even though it was being used in artwork for centuries before that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Most 360 video you can find today falls into one of two types: it either tells a story, or conveys a sense of place.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/360_1.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Quintin Hogg redesign</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/work/print/design/2016/09/01/QH-design.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quintin Hogg redesign" /><published>2016-09-02T00:35:20+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-02T00:35:20+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/work/print/design/2016/09/01/QH-design</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/work/print/design/2016/09/01/QH-design.html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Quintin Hogg&lt;/em&gt; newspaper is the latest in a long tradition of student publications at the University of Westminster.

&lt;p&gt;The redesign was conducted over summer and was intended to be a complete departure from the previous look. This was partly for simple modernisation, but also an opportunity to bring the &lt;em&gt;QH&lt;/em&gt; in line with new joint student media brand guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

A five-column grid was selected for all pages, to avoid the mishmash of designs that had afflicted earlier incarnations of the &lt;em&gt;QH&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Victoria Park’s somewhat misnamed Field Day festival brings together alt and indie artists over two days and half a dozen stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City centre festivals always bring particular challenges, since there’s no campsite to build the community spirit they rely on. What’s a festivalgoer to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The good&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masked Swedish world-fusion act Goat&lt;/strong&gt;. Since they gyrated onto the scene in 2013, as Glastonbury took a punt on the unknown collective, they’ve grown and grown. Not bad for a gang of stoners from Gothenberg. The masks probably help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday headliner PJ Harvey’s music&lt;/strong&gt; is nothing short of haunting, but her performance adds an extra dimension to the tunes. As she plumbs her back-catalogue, she flits between the stage personas that originally made her famous. These multiple personalities are expressed in dance, voice, gesture, and you’re in no doubt when she moves from one to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PJ Harvey’s feathers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/field_day_2.jpeg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This one’s dedicated to everyone who has an iPhone and isn’t currently on it”, Swedish electro-popster Molly Nilsson says during her stripped down set. &lt;strong&gt;Smartphones&lt;/strong&gt; may not encourage the transcendent, pure musical experience festivals sell us tickets on, but they must be good otherwise we wouldn’t all have them. So by that logic, being able to go home and charge them every night must be good too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No one has brought wellies.&lt;/strong&gt; No one. Despite being able to check the weather forecast in the morning and access a normal wardrobe. For the select few who did choose appropriate footwear, this presents an opportunity. You get free reign over the muddier parts of the arena — usually the shortest routes from place to place. Enjoy: you’re practically a god in these parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The toilets.&lt;/strong&gt; They aren’t quite as disgusting as a countryside festival, so it counts as a win!
What’s this? Enough benches and tables for festivalgoers to actually sit down on while they eat/drink/consume? You mean we don’t have to squat in the mud? Surely you’re joking, Mr Feynman. Glastonbury could learn a thing or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The bad&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have never known true fury until you have seen a press photographer cover a festival headliner with &lt;strong&gt;an iPhone and a vintage film SLR&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DJs.&lt;/strong&gt; DJs everywhere. It’s like East London has run out of bars, clubs and pubs and needs to conjure up more stages to keep them in headphones and vinyl. DJs between acts, DJs on bandstands, DJs in tucked away corners of the arena playing to each other. DJs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s easy to forget you aren’t in a field in the middle of nowhere. Photo: Carolina Faruolo &amp;amp; Linn Koch-Emmery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The price.&lt;/strong&gt; Say what you will about Field Day, but it certainly gives value for money. The calibre of the acts are impressive given tickets are a mere £50 for a day and £99 for the weekend, at a time where larger festivals are pushing £250 for their weekend offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the music ends, you remember this is the centre of London and you don’t have a tent, so you find yourself either handing your life savings over to Uber or making the most of your transport knowledge to find a route home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The panicked journey&lt;/strong&gt; to get back before last tubes when you realise you already gave your life savings to your landlord, because you live in London. Almost makes you long for camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a first for student media, since Students’ Union staff had previously held their own debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since none of us had any formal training in the television industry, we had to invent new solutions to every problem (How do we get good, radio friendly sound? How do we manage the gaps between debates? Where should we position cameras?), learning as we went along, inspired only by things we’d seen on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully executing this concept required over a dozen crew members and coordination of nearly thirty on-screen guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later, we planned the second annual edition of the show, which was broadcast in full HD for the first time, and was the most viewed programming of the semester. I’m happy to see that they have become a much-loved fixture of Forge electin coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">In spring 2015, I served as producer of Forge Debates, a two-part live debate staged as a key part of our coverage of Sheffield Students’ Union’s annual elections.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/debates_1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What went wrong with the new day?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/02/09/What-went-wrong-with-the-new-day.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What went wrong with the new day?" /><published>2016-02-09T23:35:20+00:00</published><updated>2016-02-09T23:35:20+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/02/09/What-went-wrong-with-the-new-day</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/02/09/What-went-wrong-with-the-new-day.html">&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the experimental newspaper the &lt;em&gt;New Day&lt;/em&gt; will print what it likely to be its last edition, after a mere sixty-eight days of circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project’s life has been shorter than even its own “Life is short, let’s live it well” slogan predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry insiders say the circulation had dropped below the 40,000 figure, which means the national publication, printed by the same people who churn out the &lt;em&gt;Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, was printing less than twenty times the circulation of my student rag, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forgetoday.com/press&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forge Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unexpectedly excited when the &lt;em&gt;New Day&lt;/em&gt; launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months into a postgraduate journalism course, I’d been submerged in a world of journalists bemoaning the inevitable end of print, talking &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; this and &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; that. Social video, clickbait, analytics and content aggregation were the buzzwords of modern trade. &lt;strong&gt;The first tool I was taught to use for journalism was a smartphone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/new_day_2.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The first journalistic tool I was taught to use was the smartphone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this unfamiliar backdrop, the idea of a new print newspaper, taking the best parts of online, made waves in my mind. The art direction, standing apart from other Trinity Mirror titles and evoking high quality magazine, had no small part in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dutifully picked up the first, free edition of the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We’ll try to be positive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New Day&lt;/em&gt;’s editorial ethos was well-placed. “ We won’t sensationalise or terrify you with the news.” they claim &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenewday.co.uk/&quot;&gt;on their landing page&lt;/a&gt;, “and above all, we’ll try to be positive”. That’s a position not unrelated to the dull feel-goodism of &lt;em&gt;Upworthy&lt;/em&gt; and other online news sources targeted at millenials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attitude in a website is stale. But in a newspaper, it felt like a vital USP; a statement that one of the things most hated about traditional papers — their steeping negativity — didn’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be true. In a post-Leveson world, perhaps this could win back the hearts and minds of the public. Journalists, after all, still rank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3685/Politicians-are-still-trusted-less-than-estate-agents-journalists-and-bankers.aspx&quot;&gt;just below estate agents&lt;/a&gt; on scales of public trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/new_day_3.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The New Day’s feel-good attitude was a clear reaction to the prevalence of that attitude on the web.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t long before the cracks in the dream started to show. I never picked up another edition of the &lt;em&gt;New Day&lt;/em&gt; after that first, free edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to why that happened, I don’t know. Perhaps the *New Day *never offered anything to my generation that online wasn’t already giving us. There’s no shortage of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New Day&lt;/em&gt; had virtually no online presence. Their website has a logo, a short message, and links to Facebook and Twitter. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this wasn’t the point of the experiment, the paper’s failure proves that &lt;strong&gt;it’s basically impossible to gain any market share unless it’s doing so on the back of online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/new_day_4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;While pretty, this isn’t what you want your website to look like unless you’re in the middle of upgrading it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend, Robin Wilde, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/cubed?ty=h&quot;&gt;creating a gaming magazine&lt;/a&gt;. It’s traditional in every way, but print came after online. To succeed with a publication, you need to build an audience online first, because that’s where the youngsters go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/new_day_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;The printed Cubed Gamers magazine.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older demographics couldn’t save the &lt;em&gt;New Day&lt;/em&gt; either, as its uplifting but apparently ineffectual $5m TV ad campaign shows. The Boomers and their children are comfortable with their &lt;em&gt;Suns&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Daily Mails&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt;. It was pitching young content at an old audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Decades too late&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a future of print to be had, now is clearly not the time to discover it. There is still too much flux, too much change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in a decade or so, the industry will find another steady state. But at the moment newspapers survive only due to their size, with the smaller players shutting down weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps newspapers will survive as vanity objects. Perhaps they will need to put quality over quantity, becoming even more like magazines. As the generations advance, perhaps soon no one will get their news from dead trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever went wrong with the &lt;em&gt;New Day&lt;/em&gt;, the concept always felt slightly off-colour. The attempt was admirable, but its existence was either decades too early or (more likely) decades too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won’t know which for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">On Friday, the experimental newspaper the New Day will print what it likely to be its last edition, after a mere sixty-eight days of circulation.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/new_day_1.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Being an SU Officer</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/work/video/2016/02/01/being-an-officer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Being an SU Officer" /><published>2016-02-01T23:35:20+00:00</published><updated>2016-02-01T23:35:20+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/work/video/2016/02/01/being-an-officer</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/work/video/2016/02/01/being-an-officer.html">&lt;p&gt;In my role as a digital content producer for Sheffield Students’ Union, I produced diverse content, especially video, to support key campaigns.
