Wordpress now powers [over a quarter of the web](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-webs-unofficial-publisher), according to most estimates. Since 2003, it's matured and diversified from a simple blogging framework to a behemoth, capable of running e-commerce, full-fledged web applications, news operations and more.

But at its core, Wordpress and is still designed with blogging in mind. When you open up the post editor screen of a fresh Wordpress site, you're greeted with this:

Aside from options for titles, categories, etcetera, you are faced with what is essentially an enormous empty box, which you can fill with text.

The simple experience this provides is a beautiful gift for newcomers, but it's a poor reflection of the rich, multimedia experiences we're increasingly expecting from the modern web.



Platforms like Medium do a bit better: doing away with the front/back-end separation, and allowing users to drag and drop content right there on the front-end.

It's more intuitive, but it's still rare to see this approach fully implemented on independent websites, partly because so many are reliant on out-of-the-box software like Wordpress.




It's a key reason why a painstakingly designed website, handed off to a client, will

Or why *your* site never looks like the site in the demo, even though you used the same theme.

If you give users an empty box, the user needs to have enough of a grasp of HTML and CSS, along with the rudiments of design thinking, in order to

And that's just not something most people have time for.





A web designer dealing with one big block of "content" will be far less empowered than the designer who knows that users will be splitting their content up into "standfirst", "lead paragraph", "byline", "rating", and so on.

Content structuring is therefore just as important as design. Before the designer starts work, a conversation needs to be had about the anatomy of the content that might live on a site.



Mature multimedia experiences like the *New York Times*' seminal 2012 piece *Snow Fall* were traditionally hand-coded, relying on a developer's constant involvement, but CMSs that take content structuring seriously come capable of building these kinds of beautiful work out of the box.






In a recent project, I tried to take this lesson to heart, using Wordpress meta fields in my article template files in order to provide nicer-looking
