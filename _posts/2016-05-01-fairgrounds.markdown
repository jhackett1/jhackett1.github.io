Prompted by the appearance of the Star Flier in Sheffield city centre one day, I explored the history of these enormous transportable thrill rides, and what their proliferation means for the traditional funfairs of our childhoods.

During my investigation, I came across Carters' Steam Fair, who restore and operate original Victorian rides, touring around the south of England every summer.
