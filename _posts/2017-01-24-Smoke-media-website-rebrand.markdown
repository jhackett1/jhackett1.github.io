As part of my role as student media coordinator, I initiated a ground-up rebuild of Smoke Media's web presence. Initially, this consisted of a Youtube channel, two aged and dissimilar Wordpress sites, and a free Wix site. All used out-of-the-box templates with minimal customisation, Most importantly, all were very different from each other.

One of my strategic priorities was to shift Smoke Media from a print-first to a digital-first organisation, reflecting the shift going on in the wider world. It was also vital to communicate a single, converged brand to our audience.

I met with student stakeholders to come up with a feature set and compile design ideas for the new website. I introduced students to a common web design progress: brief, wireframe, mockups, prototypes, product!

It was very important that the new site automate common tasks such as the uploading of electronic versions of print publications, a process which involved many manual, tedious steps. Integration with external services such as Youtube, Audioboom and a number of custom in-house APIs was also necessary.
